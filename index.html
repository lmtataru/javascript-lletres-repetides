        <!-- Phase 1:
                create an array with your name where each position corresponds to a letter
                make a loop that traverses this array and displays each of the letters in the console
            Phase 2:
                in the loop, if the letter is a vowel it prints on the console: "I found the VOWEL: _". Otherwise, print: "I found the CONSONANT: __"
                If you find a number, show by template: 'People names do not contain the number: __ "
            Phase 3:
                store on a map both the letters in the list (or array) and the number of times they appear
            Phase 4:
                create another list with your last name where each position corresponds to a letter
                merges the two lists into one. in addition, it adds a position with an empty space between the first and the second. that is, we start from the list name and surname and at the end of the execution we will only have one that will be called fullname -->
